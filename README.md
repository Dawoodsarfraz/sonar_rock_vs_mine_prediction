## Overview
This project focuses on building a **Logistic Regression** model to distinguish between **sonar signals reflected from rocks and underwater mines**. It aims to improve classification accuracy and support oceanic exploration and detection tasks.

The workflow includes:  
- **Data preprocessing**: Handling sonar signal data for model training.  
- **Model training**: Using **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.  
- **Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy and performance to ensure reliable predictions.

## Key Features
- Classification of sonar signals into rock or mine categories.  
- Use of Logistic Regression for robust binary prediction.  
- Visualization of data and decision boundaries using Matplotlib.
